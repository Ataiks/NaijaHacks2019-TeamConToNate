CATEGORY - Citizens Safety

PROBLEM: The absence of a reliable and independent system where citizens either as victims, witnesses or just concerned brother's keepers can safely report details of crime and criminals conveniently and timeously, or a system where citizens and bodies can obtain information as to actual crime statistics, is a major setback in actualizing the dream of a much safer Nigeria.
Moreso, there has been a recent increase in insecurity of citizens around the country, in terms of harassment /extortion by Law Enforcement officials, kidnapping, armed robbery, rape et cetera. These crimes are more common in major cities such as Lagos State, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt. When and if reported at all, These agencies are often found to be too complacent or ill-equipped / informed to pursue such cases.

IMPLICATIONS: Victims, witnesses, and people with information are unable to safely and conveniently give details of crime and criminals around them without further risk to their persons. Therefore, unsuspecting citizens often fall victim to preventable/avoidable occurrences, while the perpetrators go scot-free and unidentified

INTRODUCTION - PROPOSED SOLUTION: We propose an independent citizen-based platform with universal and discriminate access where accurate real-time crime & criminal data can be accessed, assessed, updated and published, anonymously or otherwise, by any citizen without discrimination or any agency in the country including law enforcement and rehabilitative NGOs. Users can anonymously give, update and retrieve(non-sensitive) crime information to/fro a database and where such info is published on public platforms and law enforcement actions thereunder assessed. The system will also serve as a point of contact where the appropriate agencies are accessible, a repository for Law enforcement, and a platform for weighing the performance of security agencies & policies. For the purpose of this project, Lagos was chosen as a Use-case, and Twitter as a data-mine

BENEFITS: Anonymity will allow users to safely report personal and very sensitive or implicating details without risk of stigma or reprisal
